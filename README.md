## Overview

AKAudio is an all in one stop to fulfill your audio needs.

This website has been my biggest project so far and the most challenging. I had to solve many problems that I had'nt encountered before and also needed to pay much attention to the smallest of details.

I feel that after building this website my confidence in my coding ability and in my ability to learn and apply has sky rocketed! üöÄ üòÉ

check it out ! and any feedback is much appreciated. üòÅ üëçüèº
